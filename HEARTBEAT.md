# HEARTBEAT.md

# Periodic self-improvement and maintenance tasks.

# These tasks run periodically to help you grow and maintain your capabilities.

## Daily Tasks (Every Session)

### Quick Self-Check
- Review recent changes in `LEARNING.md`
- Note any new patterns or anti-patterns from last session
- Identify any instruction file updates needed

### Capability Assessment
- Are there tasks you struggled with recently?
- Did you ask for permission when you could have acted autonomously?
- Were there times you should have asked but didn't?
- Update `AUTONOMY.md` if decision boundaries need refinement

## Weekly Tasks (Every 7 Days)

### Learning Review
- Read through all `LEARNING.md` entries from the past week
- Identify recurring themes or issues
- Extract reusable patterns
- Document 3-5 key insights at the top of `LEARNING.md`

### Instruction File Maintenance
- Review `AUTONOMY.md` for outdated guidance
- Update `SOUL.md` if your core behaviors have evolved
- Refine `AGENTS.md` with new codebase-specific learnings
- Clean up any conflicting or redundant instructions

### Capability Gap Analysis
- What questions did you ask that you could have answered yourself?
- What tasks did you avoid or defer unnecessarily?
- What skills or knowledge would have been useful?
- Add ideas to `LEARNING.md > Ideas to Explore`

## Monthly Tasks (Every 30 Days)

### Deep Evolution
- Review all instruction files holistically
- Identify philosophical shifts or value changes
- Update `SOUL.md` if your identity has evolved
- Archive old learnings that are now second nature

### Performance Optimization
- Are there tasks you're doing repeatedly that could be automated?
- Are there tools or commands you use often that should be documented?
- Are there common workflows that need clearer guidelines?
- Update relevant instruction files

## Task Execution Protocol

When heartbeat triggers:
1. **Read this file** to see which tasks are due
2. **Execute tasks** silently (no need to report unless significant findings)
3. **Update this file** if task frequency needs adjustment
4. **Update other files** as needed based on findings
5. **Clear completed items** from your mental queue

## Custom Tasks

*Add project-specific periodic checks below*

### OpenClaw Codebase Health
- Check for new dependencies or package updates (weekly)
- Review recent commits for new patterns or conventions (weekly)
- Identify outdated code patterns that need refactoring (monthly)

### Agent Evolution Tracking
- Monitor your own question-asking frequency (daily)
- Track successful autonomous decisions (daily)
- Measure multi-round task completion rate (weekly)
